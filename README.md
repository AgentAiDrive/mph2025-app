Absolutely! Here’s an updated, **technically driven README** for *My Parent Helpers (MPH)*, including technical concepts, context engineering, modularity, extensibility, and how the architecture supports advanced use-cases and maintainability. This version maintains clarity for power users, developers, or technical reviewers, and references “context injection”, modular domain/shortcut logic, and local data persistence.

# 🌿 My Parent Helpers (MPH) – Technical Overview

**Live Demo:** [mph-2025.streamlit.app](https://mph-2025.streamlit.app/)

---

## ⚡ About the App

**My Parent Helpers (MPH)** is a modular, extensible AI-powered context agent platform. Designed for parents, teachers, and professionals, MPH enables the creation and management of multi-role digital assistants (“Agents”) driven by context-rich, user-controlled prompt engineering.

Built in Python with Streamlit and OpenAI APIs, MPH supports custom persona creation, multi-domain context engineering, structured response formatting, and granular prompt injection—enabling highly adaptive, role- and scenario-specific answers for any user-defined need.

## 🚀 Technical Features & Architecture

### 🔧 Context Engineering & Persona Injection

* **Dynamic Persona Profiles:**

  * Agent context is synthesized from user-defined parameters (source type/name, parent/child name, age/grade, domain).
  * Persona synthesis uses multi-step knowledge assimilation (source → synthesis → summary), injected directly into the prompt system message.
  * Persona parameters are always available for injection in subsequent queries, ensuring *stateful*, contextually aware conversations.

* **Layered Prompt Injection:**

  * Prompts dynamically integrate:

    * Persona description (domain, philosophy, and actionable principles)
    * User/child names
    * Age/grade (for adaptive language)
    * User’s current query
    * Optional: Shortcut-specific response instructions (see below)
  * Injection is modular—custom domains, shortcut types, and formats can be added or changed in real time.

* **Structured Response Shortcuts:**

  * Each shortcut (Connect, Grow, Explore, Resolve, Support, etc.) defines a response template: expected structure, language level, and purpose.
  * All shortcuts are user-editable, domain-extensible, and persistently stored.

### 💡 Modular, Extensible Domain & Shortcut Logic

* **Domain-Aware Shortcuts:**

  * Domains (Parent, Teacher, Other/Custom) support their own pre-configured or custom shortcut sets.
  * New domains or expert areas can be added at runtime via editable source/shortcut JSON.

* **Fully Editable Sources & Shortcuts:**

  * Books, experts, styles, and shortcuts are fully user-editable.
  * All logic (lists, edits, persistence) is decoupled from code—empowering users to extend functionality via simple UI.

* **Profile-Specific Tooling:**

  * Enable per-profile RAG (document upload/vector search), web search, and other tools using simple checkboxes.
  * OpenAI tool calls are dynamically composed, based on profile/tool flags.

### 📦 Local-First Persistence

* **No Cloud Dependency (by default):**

  * All user data—profiles, chats, sources, shortcuts, and history—are stored locally as JSON, supporting privacy and offline access.
  * Data structure is robust, human-readable, and portable (future upgrade: optional cloud sync or export).

* **Atomic Save/Load:**

  * Every change is instantly written to disk.
  * Profiles, chats, shortcuts, and sources are updated independently for integrity and modularity.

### 🧩 Modular UI & Navigation

* **Step-based, Card-centric UI:**

  * Modular navigation logic (per-page/step) with strong separation between creation, editing, chat, history, and settings.
  * Codebase is clean, with well-separated UI, persistence, and agent logic (ideal for extension or mobile packaging).

* **Mobile-first design:**

  * Responsive CSS for card navigation, shortcut selection, and chat interfaces.
  * Tooltips and dynamic help are present throughout.
