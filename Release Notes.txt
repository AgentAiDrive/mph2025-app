***** Release v1.2.1 – “Profile-Aware Memory, Smarter History & Instant Updates” (2025-08-06) *****
***************************************************************************************************

What’s New

## Summary
This release brings profile-scoped persistent memory, seamless fallback to session memory, and instant global updates for all shortcuts, sources, and agent settings. Memory, context, and chat history management are now robust and unified—supporting flawless agent switching, reliable chat replays, and an always-up-to-date UI.

### [Added]

Profile-Aware Memory & History
- Per-Profile Persistent Memory: Every agent’s chat history is stored and loaded based on profile, ensuring the right conversation context is always injected.
- Session-Only Memory Fallback: When persistent memory is disabled, session memory is handled in-memory, enabling true stateless chats.
- Snapshot Saving: Saving a chat with persistent memory includes a full context snapshot—perfect for reloading or exporting threads.
- Unified History View: All chat histories are now directly viewable and replayable from saved chats and dashboards, with clear expanders.

Live Editing & Global Updates
- Instant Propagation: Any change to shortcuts, sources, or profiles is reflected everywhere in real time—including chat, profile editors, and saved responses.
- Atomic Save/Load: All changes are saved to disk immediately for robust, consistent local data persistence.

Context Injection & Chat Workflow
- Unified Context Injection: Every agent reply includes up-to-date persona, shortcut, and context instructions, plus full conversation history if persistent memory is enabled.
- On-the-Fly Shortcut Switching: Change shortcuts mid-conversation; edits reflect instantly in the chat and across all UIs.

UI & User Experience
- Improved History Display: Persistent and session chat histories are shown in clear expanders, with user/agent roles labeled.
- Mobile & Card UX: More tweaks for a mobile-first, card-centric experience.
- Feedback & Error Handling: Enhanced error feedback for memory, file, and API issues.

#### [Fixed]
- History Consistency: Fixed bugs where toggling persistent memory or switching profiles left chat history in a stale or out-of-sync state.
- Shortcut/Source Drift: Global edits always update all references—no more mismatches or missing buttons.
- Atomic Persistence: Prevented rare issues with silent data loss or failed saves.

##### [Coming Soon]
- Agent export/import and sharing features
- Custom agent function-calling and plugin support
- Context schema editor and visual memory tools
- Multimodal RAG: PDF/image search, advanced document tools
- Team and enterprise agent options

***** Release v1.2.0 – “Shortcuts, Hybrid Tools & Enhanced Management” (2025-08-05) *****
*****************************************************************************************

What’s New

## Summary
This release introduces a modular, fully persistent shortcut system, granular hybrid tool controls (web + document search), expanded CRUD support for profiles and sources, and a unified context-injection architecture for agentic workflows. Major refactors ensure that all shortcut, source, and tool config changes propagate instantly throughout the UI, backend, and API calls, supporting multi-domain/discipline agents and advanced RAG patterns.

### [Added]  
#### Shortcut System Refactor
Shortcut Button Editor
- **Live Editing:** Instantly edit, add, rename, or delete any shortcut button (e.g., Default, Connect, Grow) directly from the UI—no more hardcoded lists.
- **Universal Updates:** All shortcut edits are reflected everywhere, in real time, across profile builders and chat.
- **Persistence:** Shortcuts persist in `parent_helpers_shortcuts.json` for full durability.

Hybrid Tooling & RAG
- **Profile-Based Tools:** Enable or disable document (RAG) and web search for each profile, or override on a per-chat basis for ultimate flexibility.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Tool options (web/doc search, uploads) can be set at creation, editing, or chat-time—no need to rebuild profiles.
- **Automatic Cleanup:** Vector store links are automatically cleared if document search is disabled.

Profile & Source Management
- **Full Profile Editing:** Update all profile fields—including name, age, persona description, tools, and shortcuts—at any time.
- **Dynamic Source Lists:** Add or remove Books, Experts, and Styles for each agent type, with changes saved in `parent_helpers_sources.json`.
- **Data Integrity:** Profiles, responses, and shortcuts are always synced and persisted locally.

Chat, Memory & UI Enhancements
- **Responsive Shortcuts:** All edits to shortcuts are immediately available in chat; use any shortcut, any time.
- **Per-Chat Tool Toggles:** Enable or disable web/doc search per conversation without changing the profile.
- **Mobile-Optimized Dashboard:** Improved card layouts, sticky emoji nav, and clear expanders for fast access.
- **Persistent Memory Option:** Save full chat histories and recall them in any session, controlled per-chat.
- **Live Feedback:** All save/delete/send actions provide instant user feedback.

Fixes & Improvements
- **Global Consistency:** Edits to shortcuts and sources now propagate everywhere—no stale or missing options.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Better file upload, vector store, and API error feedback.
- **Unified Visual Style:** Refined look and feel for both mobile and desktop.

Coming Soon:
- Agent sharing features
- Advanced context schema editor
- Expanded AI function integrations (document tools, structured formats, more)
- v1.3 will focus on deeper agentic workflows and external integrations
